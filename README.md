**Player 1 Controls:** '**W**' = Up and '**S**' = Down<br>
**Player 2 Controls:** '**Up Arrow**' = Up and '**Down Arrow**" = Down<br>
In order to **gain 1 point**, the ball **must past** through the enemies **boundaries**!!!<br>

**First to 7 points** will **WIN THE GAME!!!**

## Atari:
Just like the **original atari**, your goal is to **break all of the blocks** without losing all **3 of your lives**! <br>
You control your paddle using the mouse, and you release the ball by clicking your mouse!!!<br>

**SPECIAL FEATURE!!!**
Speeder Powerup (3 Uses): When you hold right click, your paddle and the ball moves x2 faster (lasts as long as you hold your mouse)
